Stress detection is a challenging task, as there are so many words that can be used by people on their posts that can show whether a person is having psychological stress or not. I found a Kaggle dataset which contains posts from various subreddits in a excel file. We only need to use the text and label column for this task.
The dataset I am using for this task contains data posted on subreddits related to mental health. This dataset contains various mental health problems shared by people about their life. Fortunately, this dataset is labelled as 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no stress and 1 indicates stress. We will now try to detect stress using this data with the help of python programming language.

We have used several models and at the end compared to determine which one yields the best results in terms of accuracy.
